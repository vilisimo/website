## What?
Recently I've started playing with `Next.js`. I liked it so much I decided to rebuild my blog with it. It just so happens that I also was thinking about getting a new domain. The stars aligned and I've moved the blog to https://directedignorance.com. Come visit, perhaps you'll like it.

## Why?
### Domain
I've never really liked `vilisimo.com`. Nothing wrong with it, I just don't really enjoy it all that much. "Directed ignorance", on the other hand, reminds me of Discworld, one of my favorite book series. 

"Directed ignorance" can be interpreted in many ways. I like to think of it as an action of focusing on areas one is not familiar with, or areas that need improvement. The idea resonates with me, and I think it is fitting for a personal blog. After all, at least in my case, it is exploration of topics I am not necessarily intimately familiar with.

### Technology
I've long thought of redesigning the blog. However, while I liked Hugo at the time I built the blog, I don't really Hugo outside of it all that much. What I do use is React. I like React, and want to write more of it. Next.js happens to be a React framework. To me that seems like a good match. Besides, I've tried it before and I really liked it. I found it to be intuitive and pleasant to work with.

Is it overkill for a blog? Absolutely. However, I'm not aiming for perfect usability/performance/etc scores. I use it because I find it pleasant, and because it's less likely I'll forget how to do things with it. Which is a major pain point with Hugo - every time I have to look up how to do things. That takes a lot of time. And at the moment I don't have that much time to spare.

## Future
In the future, please use https://directedignorance.com. I will keep https://vilisimo.com for a while, but I will not post more updates here. 

Thanks for visiting and see you at https://directedignorance.com!
