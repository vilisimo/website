## What
`tables` is a library that provides basic tools to build a table and print it 
to a terminal. It was extracted from [tasks](https://github.com/vilisimo/tasks)
project, when printing a proper table proved to be more tricky than the whole
project itself.

## Why
There was no intention to write anything related to the tables when I started
the [tasks](https://github.com/vilisimo/tasks) project. However, once I began
thinking about how to approach printing multiline tables to a terminal it
quickly became clear that a few newlines here and there would not suffice.
